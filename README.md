# Medicinal Plant Identification System:

## Introduction about the Project:
In recent years, there has been a growing interest in the utilization of medicinal plants for their therapeutic properties. Recognizing the importance of accurate plant identification for herbal medicine and botanical research, we have developed a Medicinal Plant Identification System. This innovative project harnesses the power of technology to facilitate the identification and categorization of various medicinal plants.

## Objective :
The primary objective of our Medicinal Plant Identification System is to provide a reliable and efficient tool for botanists, herbalists, researchers, and enthusiasts to quickly identify medicinal plants based on their visual attributes. This system aims to bridge the gap between traditional knowledge of plant identification and modern technological advancements, making it easier for users to access information about the medicinal properties of plants.
